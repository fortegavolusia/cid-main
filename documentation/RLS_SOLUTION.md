# RLS Implementation Solution

## Overview
Successfully implemented Row Level Security (RLS) using JWT-embedded filters with subquery resolution for email-to-UUID mapping.

## Key Fix: Subquery for UUID Resolution
Since `assigned_to` column is UUID type but we have email in JWT, use subquery:

```sql
assigned_to IN (SELECT id FROM inventory.users WHERE email = @current_user_email)
```

## Variable Substitution
The system automatically replaces:
- `@current_user_email` → actual user email from JWT
- `@current_user_id` → user sub from JWT
- `@current_user_department` → department from JWT

## Working Example
Input filter from UI:
```
assigned_to IN (SELECT id FROM inventory.users WHERE email = @current_user_email)
```

After processing in backend:
```sql
(assigned_to IN (SELECT id FROM inventory.users WHERE email = 'FOrtega@volusia.gov'))
```

## Files Modified
1. `/home/dpi/projects/inventory/backend/simple_main.py` - Fixed indentation, type checking
2. `/home/dpi/projects/CID/backend/api/main.py` - Fixed JWT structure generation (lines 1494-1501)

## Testing
Confirmed working with 200 OK responses when applying RLS filters with subquery.
