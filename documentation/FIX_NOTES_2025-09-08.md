# CID Authentication Fix - September 8, 2025

## Problem Solved
Fixed Azure AD authentication error: "AADSTS9002327: Tokens issued for the 'Single-Page Application' client-type may only be redeemed via cross-origin requests"

## Root Cause
Azure AD was configured as a Single-Page Application (SPA) but the token exchange was being performed server-side (same-origin) instead of client-side (cross-origin).

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Issue in Backend
**File**: `backend/libs/logging_config.py`
- Changed: `from backend.utils.paths import logs_path, config_path`
- To: `from utils.paths import logs_path, config_path`
- Reason: Inside Docker container, the working directory is `/app`, not `/app/backend`

### 2. Fixed Dockerfile
**File**: `backend/Dockerfile`
- Removed the COPY requirements.txt step that was failing
- Directly install Python packages with pip since no requirements.txt exists

### 3. Fixed SPA Authentication Flow
**File**: `cids-frontend/src/services/authService.ts`
- Modified `exchangeCodeForToken()` method to:
  1. Exchange authorization code directly with Azure AD (cross-origin)
  2. Receive Azure AD tokens (access_token and id_token)
  3. Send Azure tokens to CID backend for JWT generation
- This matches the SPA authentication pattern expected by Azure AD

## Docker Commands Used
```bash
# Rebuild and restart services
docker-compose down
docker-compose build cid-backend
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker logs cid-backend --tail 50
docker logs cid-frontend --tail 30
```

## Testing URLs
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000/login
- Backend API: http://localhost:8001
- JWKS Endpoint: http://localhost:8001/.well-known/jwks.json

- Size: 2.4M
- Contains working authentication configuration

## Current Status
✅ CID Backend running and healthy
✅ CID Frontend running and serving
✅ Azure AD authentication working
✅ Token exchange successful
✅ Login flow complete

## Environment Configuration
- Docker Compose with two services: cid-backend and cid-frontend
- Backend uses FastAPI with Uvicorn
- Frontend uses React with Vite
- Connected to Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Azure AD configured as SPA with PKCE flow
