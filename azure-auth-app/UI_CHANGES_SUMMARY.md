# UI Changes Summary

## What Changed

### 1. **Consolidated UI**
- Removed duplicate `apps_admin.html` template
- All admin functionality is now in the main `auth_test.html` interface
- Access admin features via the "Administration" button on the home page

### 2. **Discovery Features Added**
The main UI now includes all discovery features:

#### In App Registration Form:
- **Discovery Endpoint** field - URL where apps expose their endpoints
- **Allow Endpoint Discovery** checkbox - Enable/disable discovery

#### In App Cards:
- Discovery status display (when enabled):
  - Shows "✓ Enabled" in green
  - Displays discovery endpoint URL
  - Shows last discovery time and status
- New action buttons (when discovery enabled):
  - **View Endpoints** - See registered/discovered endpoints
  - **Run Discovery** - Trigger endpoint discovery

### 3. **URL Routing**
The UI now updates the browser URL as you navigate:
- `/` - Home page
- `/admin` - Administration panel
- `/admin/tokens` - Token management
- `/admin/apps` - App registration management

Browser back/forward buttons now work correctly.

## How to Access

1. **Home Page**: `https://10.1.5.58:8000/`
2. **Administration**: Click "Administration" button when logged in
3. **App Registration**: 
   - Click "Administration" → "App Registration" tab
   - OR navigate directly to `https://10.1.5.58:8000/admin/apps`

## Testing Discovery

1. **Enable Discovery for Flask App**:
   - The Flask app already has discovery enabled
   - You should see the discovery section in its card

2. **Run Discovery**:
   - Click "Run Discovery" button on the Flask app
   - Make sure `test_app.py` is running first
   - You'll see a loading overlay while discovery runs

3. **View Endpoints**:
   - Click "View Endpoints" to see discovered endpoints
   - Discovered endpoints are marked with "(discovered)"

## Production-Ready Changes

- Cleaner, more professional styling
- Better loading states with overlays
- Consistent color scheme
- Improved error handling
- Better responsive design
- URL routing for better navigation

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the changes:
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Make sure the server auto-reloaded (check console logs)
4. Verify the Flask app shows `allow_discovery: true` in the data

The discovery feature is now fully integrated into the main UI!
